      <h1>Reading from CSVs</h1>

      <p>One of my favorite technical concepts from module 1 was learning how to read from CSV files. This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to take data from a spreadsheet and write ruby code to interact, manipulate and correlate the data sets.<br>
        <br>
        We first learned about reading CSV files in Event Manager - a mini project that involved reading data from a CSV file of event attendees to send follow up information such as texts and letters. It also allowed us to find when the best time to target attendees for future registrations by identifying when they registered.<br>
        <br>
        In our last pair project of module 1 we really got to see the power of reading from CSV files with Black Thursday. The Black Thursday project used data from an online retailer in various CSV files to perform some business analytics. By reading and comparing data from more than 5 different CSV files we were able to find the top selling merchants, top selling items, what days had the most invoices and various other analytics that could potentially benefit the business.<br>
        <br>
        Being able to work with CSV files and real data, it was one of the first projects that allowed me to see just how powerful Ruby can be and how we can use it in a practical business setting instead of just hypothetical projects. </p>
