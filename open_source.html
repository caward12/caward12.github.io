      <h1>My Experience Contributing to Open Source</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p class ="date"> August 1, 2017</p>
      <p>Open source is a great way to get involved in the developer community, get exposure to brownfield code and practice your skills. During Mod 4, I contributed to three different open source projects in various ways. </p>
      <br>
      <p>A good first place to start when thinking about contributing, if you know ruby/rails, is Ruby for Good. Ruby for Good is an event that take place each year in Washington DC where Ruby developers from around the world come together for a weekend to work on projects that help communities. Projects are listed on their site and those who don’t/can’t attend can contribute year round. Getting started with open source can be intimidating, but you don’t necessarily start an entirely new feature- you can confirm a bug, update documentation, or check out an issue card. I did a little bit of all of these in my first go-round with open source!</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Projects I Contributed To:</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Ruby For Good - Pantry Scheduler</h4>
      <p>Pantry Scheduler is a scheduling system for Elizabeth House Food panty that allows volunteers to create appointments for clients. It also runs reports. </p>
      <strong>My contribution<strong>
        <p>- Bug confirmation - They had a bug issue card that when you logged in and tried to book an appointment, when you entered in a name, you could see the date picker through the list of names. I cloned down the repo and set it up locally, logged in with a seeded user and tried to re-create the issue. Which I was able to do! Then I added two comments to the issue with information on what browser(and version) and what operating system I was using. Bug confirmations help confirm that the issues exists on other machines and not just a one-off problem.  </p>

      <h4>Ruby For Good - Scan Donation</h4>
      <p>SCAN donation is a donation app for Stop Child Abuse Now of Northern VA. The project was tasked with helping them sync data from Square to Salesforce. This included turning Customers into Contacts, Transactions into Opportunities, and setting a cron job to run the script at midnight everyday.</p>
      <strong>My contribution</strong>
        <p>- Update Readme - The readme for this project was very limited and so after setting up the project on my local machine, I documented the steps I took and added them to the Readme incase anyone else wanted to contribute in the future.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Women Rising </h4>
      <p>Women Rising is an open source project that helps to promote women by assisting them in finding female peers and mentors in their field. I found this project through a meet up group - Equality Hackers in the Denver area that takes on open source projects to work on every 3-4 months. I was attracted to this project because I think female mentoring, especially in the the tech industry is really important. I attended my first meet up in early July. After talking with another woman in attendance who was an android developer, we thought it would be great to have an android app. This would require having an api in order to connect the two apps. I have experience in building api endpoints and decided to take on this task.</p>
      <strong>My Contribution</strong>
        <p>- After a more recent meetup and further discussions with the android developer, I submitted a work-in-progress pull request with one api endpoint so that others could review and then the android developer could work with my branch to test on the android side of things. I’m excited to continue to work on this project and contribute to the api development. </p>

      <h3>Things I learned:</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>- Aquatinting yourself with someone else’s code is a skill —- that you can practice</li>
	       <p>&nbsp &nbsp Diving into an existing project that you did not build can be hard. But just like any other skill, you can practice and get better at it. Knowing where to start to explore the code base is a good place to start - I learned that for me, reviewing routes, controllers and models was a good starting place and then reviewing the test suite helps a lot as well. Lastly, I like to run localhost and see what the app does in development. </p>

        <li>- Documentation is important</li>
	       <p>&nbsp &nbsp Projects that lack documentation can be hard to get started with. If you don’t know if there are special set up instructions you may just avoid contributing all together. Good documentation of set up instructions, testing, or any other important notes are vital, especially for open source projects looking for contributors.</p>

        <li>- There are a lot of really interesting open source projects</li>
	       <p>&nbsp &nbsp Ruby for Good, as I mentioned above has a ton of great projects listed if you are interested in putting your programming skills to use to help communities. Not only are they giving back to communities, but they are working on really interesting technical challenges!</p>
