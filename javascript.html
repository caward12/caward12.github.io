      <h1>Using Ruby to Learn Javascript</h1>
    </div>

      <p>During the last sprint of Cloney Island, I worked with Javascript, D3 and Dimple.js to create graphs and charts for an analytics dashboard. I ended up doing a fair amount of logic in Javascript. I had very little experience with Javascript and it turns out I used a lot of my Ruby knowledge to get the data ready for the charts. There are some definite similarities between the two:</p> 

<p>- .slice</p>
<p>Both Ruby and Javascript have a slice method that is used on strings to “slice” it given the argument past in. </p>

<p>- .push</p>
<p>Push in both Ruby and Javascript adds things on to the end of an Array.

<p>- .sort</p>
<p>Sort will sort items in an array based on their value ascending. For both Ruby and Javascript, they treat letters as a-z value (a is less than z)</p>

<p>And some definite differences:</p>

<p>- objects vs. hash</p>
<p>In ruby objects wrapped in {} are called hashes and in Javascript they are called objects. While their names are different, in many ways they behave the same. They both have key value pairs and you can call .key(s) or .value on them. </p>

<p>- ++ vs. +=</p>
<p>To increase a number by one in Ruby you use 1+= and in Javascript you use i++. </p>

<p>I really enjoyed working with Javascript during this project and I look forward to learning more similarities between it and Ruby in the future! </p>
